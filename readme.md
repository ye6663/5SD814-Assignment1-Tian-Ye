**Course:** 5SD814 - Game Programming 1  
**Student:** [Tian Ye] (tye050321@163.com)

## Description

This project implements a 2D renderer for a procedurally generated asteroid field using Raylib. The implementation includes:

- Scene management with a uniform grid spatial partitioning system
- View frustum culling for performance optimization
- Render command queue with sorting by layer/z-index
- Debug visualization including a minimap and performance stats

## How to Use

1. Use W key to apply thrust to the spaceship
2. Use A and D keys to rotate the spaceship
3. Press F1 to toggle debug visualization
4. Fly around the asteroid field and observe the rendering optimizations

## Collaborators
